Endpoint

CamelContext
A CamelContext object represents the Camel runtime system. You typically have one CamelContext object in an application. A typical application executes the following steps.

1. Create a CamelContext object.
2. Add endpoints – and possibly Components, which are discussed in Section 4.5 ("Components") – to the CamelContext object.
3. Add routes to the CamelContext object to connect the endpoints.
4. Invoke the start() operation on the CamelContext object. This starts Camel-internal threads that are used to process the sending, receiving and processing of messages in the endpoints.
5. Eventually invoke the stop() operation on the CamelContext object. Doing this gracefully stops all the endpoints and Camel-internal threads
