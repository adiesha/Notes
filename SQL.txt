USER_TAB_COLS
USER_TAB_COLS describes the columns of the tables, views, and clusters owned by the current user. This view differs from "USER_TAB_COLUMNS" in that hidden columns are not filtered out. Its columns (except for OWNER) are the same as those in "ALL_TAB_COLS". To gather statistics for this view, use the ANALYZE SQL statement.
