users can belong to ultiple groups 
groups can not contain other groups
files and directories belong to one owner
files and directories belong to one group owner
permission can be set for user, group or other
in order to change the ownership of the file you need to either root or elevate privileges with sudo 


chmod


chmod ugo-x file
chmod u-x file
chmod u=x,g=rx,o=rw file

for directories maximum initial permission is 777 since execute in a directory does not pose a security risk
maximum initial permission for file is 666

when we need to find out default permission to these wwe can substract this value by umask

ex:
usask - 0002

default dir permission = 777 - 002 = 775
default file permission = 666 - 002 = 664

umask - 0022

default dir permission = 777 - 022 = 755
default file permission = 666 - 022 = 644

SUID and SGID are special bits for privilege escalation on executable file. SUID bit allows non user owners execute commands wth the privilege of the user owner

rwsr-xw-x 1 root root /usr/bin/su	

if s => execute is already set
if S => execute permissions are not set

setting SUID bit
chmod 4755 /usr/bin/su
chmod u+s /usr/bin/su

SGID is simillar to SUID 
when SGID is set, s resides in execute position of the group owner's permissions. when regular user executes a command with a SGID bit set it runs with the privileges of the group owner of the file

chmod 2755 /usr/bin/screen
chmod g+s /usr/bin/screen

these files allow executing commands without prompting password

to find files with SUID and SGID files use 
sudo find / -perm -4000

SGID and sticky are special bits for directories

sticky bit 

chmod 1777 stickyDir
