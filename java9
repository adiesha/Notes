Lambda expressions can access 
	static fields of the enclosing class
	instance fields of the enclosing class

How - They store a reference to the enclosing object

Lambda expressions can access local variables of the enclosing method provided they are effectively final

How - They store a copy of their value

lambdas and anonymous classes may have simalarities but not equal

	Lambdas only work for FIs
	Anonymous classes can have states
	Lamdas are more succints (less code to do same thing)
	Lambdas do not create additional class files like ananomous classes
	Not every occurance of lambda functions create new objects
